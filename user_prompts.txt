# Database Design Project - User Prompts

## Section 1: Product Requirements Document (PRD) Creation
- I want to develop a database driven web application for travel planning tailored for U.S. National Park enthusiasts. The project proposal containing product specifications is given in the attachment. Please develop a set of PRD for this brand new application in file 01_PRD_v1.md

## Section 2: Entity Identification
- I would like you to go through the PRD attached and identify all the entities that will eventually be used to develop ERD.

## Section 3: Core MVP Entities and Attributes
- let us focus first on core MVP Entities. can you list these and their associated attriutes in 03_entities_attributes_v1.md? I just want the list of entities and their respective attributes. don't add any other info.

## Section 4: ERD Creation in DBML Format
- use the attached document to create ERD in the dbml format. save it as 04_ERD_diagram_v1.dbml in dbml format specification

## Section 5: DDL Schema Generation
- thats great! now, can you convert this dbml into a DDL script for creating the tables and relationships. create the file 05_DDL_schema_v1.sql. This is for a SQLite database. DO NOT include DML (insert statements!!)

## Section 6: DML Data Population
- Now can you create 06_DML_data_v1.sql that has the DML SQL statements that populates data in the tables referenced in 05_DDL_schema_v1.sql? This is for a SQLite database.

## Section 7: Streamlit Dashboard Application
- create a simple streamlit python dashboard app in a single python file called "07_sample_app.py". This is a dashboard that has one tab that shows products and companies in a table. Also, show the sql query used to generate this data on the side. Do not overcomplicate the code with functions, validations. This is a simple demo app to showcase how we can build apps. use this SQLite database /Users/46773437/Dropbox/Data/SMU_teaching/Database/2025_Fall_Karthik/itom6265_vscode/sqlite_database.db

## Section 8: Application Enhancement Request
- the app is not up to specification. I need to let users plan trips, save trips, see park and flight and lodging information and there needs to be LLM integration with SQL Chat or RAG as well
