ParkPal Database Development - Conversation Prompts Log
================================================================

1. Initial Database Setup
   - "Access denied for user 'group12'@'%' to database 'ParkPal'"
   - Modified DDL script to use existing 'group12' database instead of creating new database

2. Views Clarification
   - "there are v_ tables that I don't understand"
   - "i see the tables were created but...not able to see them under the tables tab"
   - "perfect, now i have the tables"

3. DML Script Creation
   - "create 06_DML_data_v1.sql"
   - "In National_Park, input accurate data for all 63 national parks"
   - "In Airport, input accurate data for 5 nearest airports each for [5 parks]"
   - "In Flight create 10 fictional flights each to the 5 national parks"
   - "insert airport id information as well"
   - "can you make all dates in flights to january 2026 dates"
   - "save all files so far"

4. Return Flights
   - "does flight table have flights back from the park?"
   - "yes please"

5. Lodging Data
   - "Lodging - Create DML statements to populate the Lodging table with 5 fictional lodging options"

6. Park_Airport Data
   - "Park_Airport - Create DML statements to populate the Park_Airport table using existing park_ID and airport_ID values from the National_Park and Airport tables. Calculate distance_miles between each park and airport using latitude and longitude from the related tables. Use the table structure defined in 05_DDL_schema_v1.sql."

7. Script Execution Issues
   - "add code at the beginning to drop existing tables when running the file"
   - "Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails"
   - "Column count doesn't match value count at row 17"
   - Fixed by adding explicit Park_ID values to all 63 national parks

8. Streamlit Dashboard App
   - "create a streamlit python dashboard app in a single python file called '07_sample_app.py'. use the prd app description to create this. add a page for a llm chat called parkbot for which I have an api key from open ai use latest version of chat gpt for this, do you need my database and api key information"
   - Provided database credentials and OpenAI API key from .env file

9. App Deployment Issues
   - "run the app"
   - "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mysql'"
   - "i have it installed, check again which environment should i be using"
   - Installed mysql-connector-python and python-dotenv in virtual environment

10. Database Connection Issues
    - "Database connection failed: 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'doadmin'@'129.119.235.26'"
    - "not working"
    - "i changed the .env file to take out ssl information"
    - "not working still"
    - "re-run the code"
    - "find where doadmin is"
    - "the app is not running"
    - "its running but the database connection error is still there"
    - "not working"
    - "re-run the app"
    - "the app is not running"
    - Added override=True to load_dotenv() and then hardcoded credentials temporarily

11. GitHub Repository
    - "can i commit all changes to the github repository i set up earlier"
    - GitHub push protection blocked commit due to hardcoded API key
    - Removed hardcoded secrets and pushed successfully

12. Documentation
    - "create a txt file with all of our prompts so far"
